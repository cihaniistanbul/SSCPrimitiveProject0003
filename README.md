In this project, I began to learn Java practically. This is the starting point for my Java journey.

My first Java code was this:<br>
[IsWorldHell.java](https://github.com/seyitserdarcihan/SSCPrimitiveProject0003/blob/main/src/learning001/IsWorldHell.java)
<br>
I wrote my first Java code on September 12, 2023.

I use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition for Java IDE.
